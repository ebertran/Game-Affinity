    <h2>About the test</h2>
    <p>The Bartle taxonomy of player types is a classification of video game players based on a 1996 paper by Richard Bartle according 
    to their preferred actions within the game. 
    The classification originally described players of multiplayer online games, 
    though now it also refers to players of single-player video games.</p>
